Translator to be used in earphones.
Uses a custom google translate extension to bypass the need for a private key


# Future ideas

I would like to create an earphone with a microphone that runs this program only. It will listen for somebody and translate it to you in your native language. Then, it will let you say something and it will translate it to the language you are been spoken to in. 

Eventually, I would like to have the program give suggestion replies but I will take time to design how this is implemented so it doesnt ruin the user experience.
